            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>TO finde out a word more ſignificant or proper then <hi>Minervall,</hi> to expreſſe a Tutors honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble due recompence, were a thing as hard for me, as it was to Ariſtotle for to giue a reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, why there<note place="margin">30. Sect. Proble. 10.</note> was not a certaine price &amp; reward appointed for lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, aſwell as for all Labours and Exerciſes of the Bodie.</p>
               <p>Al men know that, <hi>hier,</hi> and <hi>ſalarie,</hi> are vnworthy to be attributed to a Tutor, who as he is a free man ſhould freely be dealt with, and as his profeſſion is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral and of liberal <hi>Arts,</hi> ſo ſhoulde his recompence be of liberalitie rather then of precedent pactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The ingenuous Tutor will bluſh to ſet price on his lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, as <hi>Apollodorus</hi> the Painter did on his pictures, before he ſhewed them; but like <hi>Xeuxes</hi> rather, will freelie beſtow his indeuours and paines on his Pupil eſteeming no price worthy to match or cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tervaile them. Nether craues he dubble paiment, like <hi>Gorgias</hi> or <hi>Protagoras,</hi> but what a Noble man liberally offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, he receiueth thankfullie, as <hi>Socrates</hi> did of his Diſciples.</p>
               <p>Jt is too baſe either for a Noble man or Tutor, to marchandize for wages mechannicallie, with vvhat wil you giue? Or what wil you take? <hi>Plato</hi> would not compact ſo with <hi>Dion,</hi> or <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> with <hi>Alexander, Xenophon</hi> with <hi>Ageſilaus, Socrates</hi> with <hi>Timotheus,</hi> or <hi>Lyſides</hi> with <hi>Epaminondas.</hi> With what alacritie trow yee, ſhoulde a man goe about a leſſon for his
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:8512:24"/> Scholler, when pure neede compels him to prouide otherwiſe for his neceſſitie? <hi>Phormio</hi> the Athenian refuſed to bee Generall in the warrs of <hi>Peloponeſus,</hi> becauſe he was poore; his reaſon, as I conceit, is verie allowable and good: for a poore man hath neither great authoritie in commanding, nor a quiet minde to thinke of thoſe things that be neceſſarie. So let a Scholler haue manie good parts in him, and yet liue in want, he is neglected. Let him be vertuous as <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stides,</hi> learned as <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> eloquent as <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> if his attire bee baſe, his wordes ſhall ſeldome be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
<q>—Rara in tenui facundia panno.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Suffer not then the Tutors wants to diſgrace him, chieflie with his Pupil, of whom he ſhoulde bee moſt honoured, if euer you meane to haue him profit. For <hi>Honor</hi> is the ſecond part of a Tutors <hi>Minervall.</hi>

               <q>Honos alit artes.</q>
               <p>You muſt therefore perſwade your Sonne euer to haue a good opinion of his Tutor, that ſo abſolute a man as he, you could finde no where to inſtruct him. To induce him to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiue thus firſt of his Tutor, next of his Booke, there is no better waie, then to vſe the Tutor kindly your ſelfe, and as your familiar, ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie in your Sonnes preſence to grace &amp; reſpect him. For how can the Pupil reuerence him, whom the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents ſo little regard?

                  </note> pitiful effect her after, my aduiſe is that huſba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d sleaue their wiues ſo much of their liuings, as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>petentlie &amp; largely may maintaine their eſtate, according to the qualitie of their houſe &amp; age: and for the reſt to leaue it a mongſt his children, according to the laws of the Country where they are borne, hoping that they will haue more wit, reaſon, and diſcretion (if they bee of ful yeeres) then their wiues; conſidering the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their ſex. But if the children be in their mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, there is ſome ſhewe of reaſon that the mothers ſhould haue the adminiſtratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the childrens goods
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:8512:31"/> vntil they come to full age themſelues, to haue the managing thereof by the Lawes of the Country; yea if there bee not ſufficient goods for both Mother and children: they ſhould rather lacke then ſhee: becauſe neede and want is much more vnſeemelie &amp; difficult for woemen to endure then me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
               <p>To end then this duetie of a Father, &amp; to keepe his bones from curſing either by his wife or children: as alſo to ſaue the Sonnes from their Mothers curſe: &amp; laſtly the Lawyers from mony, and the whole houſe from decaie; my opinion is, that the beſt diſtribution of goods is, when you die, to diſtribute them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the cuſtome of the Country. The Laws haue thought better vpon them then you: your goods are not properlie your owne: ſince without your aduiſe in particular, they are ordained by a Civil proſcriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to certaine ſucceſſours. And albeit your libertie be ſomewhat extended, I thinke it verie Jniuſtice to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue &amp; debar one of that right which Fortuen hath alotted him, and the common Lawes of the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trie haue called him vnto: except there be an evident rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and cauſe to the contrarie. What can be more vniuſt then to make a man looſe the benefit of his whole life, for one miſtaking, or an ill word, &amp; to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer one fault to weigh down twentie yeeres good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe? Happy he that at this laſt paſſage is readie to ſooth and applaude their will: The neweſt and lateſt action tranſporteth, not the beſt and moſt frequent offices, but the freſheſt and inſtant worke the deede. They play with their wils and teſtaments, as with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and rods, with children; to gratifie or chaſtiſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie

               <p>Firſt of al a Tutor ſhould aſke oftentimes of his Pu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pil manie queſtions; he ſhould cauſe him to ſpeake, &amp; tel his opinion at al occaſions, of euerie ſubiect.</p>
               <p>That which we knowe a right &amp; properlie is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out booke, and we may diſpoſe of it at our pleaſure. Wherfore a Tutor ſhould rather pardon his Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, for not learning by hart, 7. or 8. lines; then for not iudging wel of anie matter. So then hee muſt awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en and ſturr vp his wit by frequent demandes, making him to expreſſe his mind firſt, otherwaies he lendeth onlie a deafe eare &amp; thinketh himſelfe not of the ſett.</p>
               <p>After he hath giuen his opinion firſt, preſſe &amp; vrge him for the reaſon of his iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, to the end he ſpeak not raſhlie and vnaduiſedlie: &amp; to incourage him the more, afford it ſome praiſe, how euer it be. <hi>Socrates</hi>

So that it is not ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſimplie to tel them the Engliſh of their leſſon or to cauſe them to learne it by hart, but their Iudgment would be eſſaied at al encounters. As when they ſhal learne that <hi>Cato</hi> killed himſelfe at <hi>Vtick:</hi> and that <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> and <hi>Caſsins</hi> were the authors of <hi>Caeſars</hi> death: I would heare their iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, if they did al wel or not; if they deſerued wel or not of their Country for ſo doing: if they did with wiſdome, prudence, Iuſtice, &amp; valour, wherin they did wel, and wherin euil.</p>

               <p>Firſt I commend vnto your diligent reading the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie of the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Testament,</hi> wherein ye may profit more, both for Religion and ſtate matters, &amp; for the particular leading of your owne life, then in all the Greeke &amp; Latine Hiſtories, which ſtutter in reſpect of

The 5. <hi>bookes</hi> of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the book of <hi>Iudges,</hi> the 4. <hi>books</hi> of <hi>Kings, Iob, Heſter, Iudith, Ruth, Tobias,</hi> and alſo the hiſtorie of the <hi>Machabees</hi> (which is ſeparate from the other) I ſuppoſe none wil denie but they be al hiſtorical. Alſo <hi>Eſdras, Nehemias, Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiel</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> although they be Prophets, yet are their works compiled in forme of narrations, which in the <hi>Rhetoricke</hi> ſchooles are called <hi>Enunciatiue,</hi> &amp; only pertaine to hiſtories, wherin is expreſſed a thing done and perſons named.</p>
               <p>All the other <hi>Prophets</hi> although they ſpeake of the time future, which is out of the deſcription of an hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, yet either in rebuking the ſins and enormities paſt, or revealing the deſtruction of their Countrey, or cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuitie of the people, and ſuch like calamitie and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable eſtate in mouing &amp; perſwading the people, they doe recite ſome circumſtance of a narration.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> do not the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taine the temporal life of our <hi>Saviour Chriſt, King</hi> of <hi>Kings,</hi> and <hi>Lord</hi> of the world? The order and diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the text in narration, verity in ſentences, grauity and validitie in councel proueth the ſame. None wil deny the <hi>Acts</hi> to be an hiſtorie. The <hi>Epiſtles</hi> of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles</hi> do containe councels and aduertiſements reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting diuerſe places as they were an <hi>Epitome</hi> or abbreui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of hiſtorie.

As <hi>Apelles</hi> ſaid <hi>everie ſkilful man muſt be beſt beleeued in his owne profeſsion and trade.</hi> Al <hi>Aristotles</hi> works, <hi>Hippocrates, Galens, Ciceros, Euclides</hi> Elements, and ſuch like, are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed <hi>Dogmaticall,</hi> vnto the which I may adde al hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories, becauſe al Hiſtoriographers are tied to write according to the truth, as al other writers are bound to obſerue the rules and principles in that Science which they teach.</p>
               <p>Wherefore by reaſon al things written in this kind, are eaſie to be iudged by the <hi>proprieties, cauſes, rules,</hi>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:8512:88"/> and <hi>principles</hi> of the diſcipline, I wil only aduiſe you to obſerue theſe fewe thinges in reading of any hiſtorie, which is more difficult. The authors profeſſion, if he be a ſchoole man &amp; medleth onlie with ſchoole-learning, as humanity and Philoſophy, note chiefly his fine ſtile, and eloquent ſpeech; if he be a Diuine remarke church gouernment, Eccleſiaſticke matters, marriages, and ſuch like things as principalie appertaine to Theology: if he be a Lawyer learne the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerſies of the points in Law, the eſtabliſhing of ſtates, and policies: if he be a Phyſition, beleeue him beſt, when he ſpeaketh of the temperature of the aire, of health, of the complexion of Princes, of their hurts and ſickneſſes: If he be an Em<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>baſſador prie into his practicks, his intelligences, and faſhion of behauiour: If he be a man of warre, obſerue chieflie the exploits whereat he was preſent himſelfe, and things of warfar: If the author be a Courtier, you ſhal learne faſhions and ceremonies. But of whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver vocation the author be, I councel you to eſteeme moſt of ſuch Hiſtoriographers, which haue had leaſt paſſions and partialitie, and the beſt meanes to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the truth, either in beeing there themſelues in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or hauing certaine intelligence fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them that were preſent, and are men of faithful and ſincere iudgment, ſpeaking without affection. Be not of too quicke a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, nor too incredulous, leaſt yee take copper for gold, falſhood for truth, or profit not a whit at al. For manie hiſtoriographers, through ignorance, hatred, couetouſnes, and fauour of ſuch great Perſonages, as gaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> penſions, haue colored their lying, &amp; diſgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, vnder a beliefe they had, that few ſhould haue bin

               <p>The ſecond ſort of writings reſpect onlie the circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of time, place, and perſon, like a Leſbian rule, applying al things more to a glorious ſhew of Ethick, figurate, and allegorical words, then to anie Dogma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical doctrine. Such are manie books of <hi>Plato, Lucians Dialogues,</hi> and compoſitions of Orators, &amp; Poets, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding rather to pleaſure then profit.</p>
               <p>Applie not your iudgment in iudging ſuch kinde of bookes by conſidering the whole booke togither; but as one who buyeth a cloake, taketh it firſt al a ſunder, &amp; beholdeth euerie part therof by it ſelfe; ſo examine the principles and cauſes of your booke a part. Becauſe the method of iudging muſt bee according to the manner of inuention: and if the principles which yee conſider ſeparatly do agree with the rules of that Art, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which they proceede, and chieflie with the final cauſe therof, doubtleſly they will appeare far fairer and better then if yee iudged of al the booke togither.

                  <hi>Hippomachus</hi> knew the good wreſtlers only by their going through the ſtreet, as <hi>Lyſippus</hi> carued a Lyon, ſeeing but one foot: ſo many men ſeeing you paſſe by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wil co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiue preſently a good or bad opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of you. Wherefore yee muſt take very good heed vnto your feete, and conſider with what grace and countenance yee walke, that yee go not ſoftly, tripping like a wanto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> maide, nor yet ſtriding with great long paces, like thoſe Rhodomonts and Kings in Stage-plaies. Walke man-like with a graue ciuil pace, as becommeth one of your birth and age. Away with all affectation, either in hanging downe your head, as <hi>Alexander</hi> did, or ſtoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping for greater comlines, or bending your body back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Many are ſo mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrous in their manner of going, that they muſt needes either bee nodding with their head, ſhaking of their ſhoulders, playing with their hands, or capering at euery ſtep with their feete, rouling from ſide to ſide, like a Turkey Cocke. As they goe through the ſtreets, yee ſhal not ſee them goe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward one ſtep, without looking downe to the roſe vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their ſhooes; or lifting vp their hand to ſet out their band, as if it were in print; or ſetting vp the brimme of their hat, or doing ſome ſuch apiſh toy: whereof I cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>Be lowly and humble vnto al men, and the greater

The dogs of <hi>Corinth</hi> barked euer againſt the prowde and glorious folkes, and fawned vpon the humble: The <hi>Thracians</hi> contemned <hi>Lyſimachus</hi> his pride, &amp; <hi>Demetrius</hi> his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable vanitie. <hi>Marcus Antonius</hi> his diſdeining of the <hi>Romanes</hi> brought him vnto ſuch an end, &amp; was the chiefe cauſe of his ruine.

               <p>HEtherto I haue ſhewed you al the parts &amp; mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of courteſie, but as a dead man, or as a bare Anatomy, conſiſting of bones and ſinewes; and therefore now we muſt put a ſpirit and life into them, to moue al thoſe parts in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly order, which is ſpeech. Without this al your courteſies and reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, are but ſhaddowes and pictures. Speech is the image of the minde, and meſſenger of the heart, whereby al that is within a man ſhewes it ſelfe. Therefore <hi>Socrates</hi> ſaid vnto the child, <hi>Loquere vt te videam<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſpeake that I may know thee.</hi> As we iudge of mettals by the ſound: ſo doe we beſt diſcerne of a man by his ſpeech<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

<pb n="189" facs="tcp:8512:102"/> haue ſaluted your friend, I meane not that yee ſhoulde ſtande ſtill dombe, admiring his or your owne braue cloathes, as the Peacocke doth his faire feathers, or to beate your bootes with a rod, bite your nailes, chew a tooth-picker, and talke only of your horſes, hounds, of your loſſes at dice or cardes or any ſuch co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon place. But I would haue you to ſpeake, yet little, and wel. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire you to ſpeake little, becauſe, as yee ſhut your eies, when yee would hit the marke, to gather &amp; collect to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither your viſual ſpirites that are diſperſed abroade o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwaies: ſo doth our minde ſcatter it ſelfe in manie words, and by ſilence becomes more prudent. For this cauſe Nature hath doubled the organs of the foure o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſenſes, and giuen vs but one tongue, and that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed within the teeth and lips, betweene the braine &amp; the hart, ſeruing as their trunchman, hauing aboue it the inſtruments of al the reſt of the ſenſes; to the end it put foorth nothing before it take counſell of the ſaide ſenſes; and of the vnderſtanding &amp; reaſon, placed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the braine. Therefore <hi>Homer</hi> had good reaſon to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme <hi>Menelaus, Nestor</hi> and <hi>Vlyſses:</hi> who were ſlowe to ſpeake, to be the wiſeſt among al the <hi>Graecians,</hi> as he accounted <hi>Therſites</hi> their foole for his babling.</p>

               <p>I would haue you aſſured and not amazed in your ſpeech, alwaies reſpecting the perſons with a comly &amp; modeſt reuerence, vnto whom you ſpeake.

               <p>If an ancient graue man ſpeake vnto you, or on that is better then your ſelfe, harken vnto his words with re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſpect, rather like a Scholler to learne, then to a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, whom yee maie contradict.

               <p>Applie euer your words to the capacitie of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you ſpeake vnto: for I thinke hee plaieth but the pars of a ſelfe conceited foole that ſheweth himſelfe eloquent to them that vnderſtand him not.

If you ſee an honeſt man ſtand in need of anie thing, wherein you would helpe him, giue him that which you will beſtow vpon him priuatlie, neuer ſpeaking one word that it is to buy this neceſſarie, or that, committing your gift to his owne diſcretion, otherwiſe you wil make him more aſhamed of his indigency; wher in giuing him ſecretly, you ſhal ſhew your ſelfe both liberal and diſcreet. Manie there bee who neuer giue anie thing but with intention to preach abroad what a great liberal act they haue done, and would be loath to beſtowe it in their cloſet, they know not that the Goddeſſe of Liberalitie was pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with her face away-warde to ſignifie that the Gift ſhould euer be giuen in ſecret.</p>

                  <q>Vincit malos pertinax bonitas.</q> Euerie man ſhould conſider wel his own abilitie in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing: for to be liberal towards another man, &amp; thereby to hurt himſelfe, is a token of want of diſcretion.

                  <hi>eſt.</hi> I iudge him liberal vnto himſelfe, who extendeth his arme no farther then his ſleeue wil reach. For when a man ſpendeth his twelue-months allowance, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venews in foure, or fiue months, whether it be at cards, dice, or in anie orher bad vſes, I account him very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal, and wil aſſure him, that he ſhal haue time at lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to repent himſelfe of that hee hath done ſo heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly: for thoſe that helped him to ſpend it, wil not help him to get more.</p>
               <p>There is an other kinde of liberality, which ſomtime is better then this wee haue ſpoken of, in helping your freind or the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you affectionat, at al good occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, where your aſſiſtance and fauour maie further him.

It is
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:8512:125"/> both an hurt and a ſhame for a Noble man to be ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in that play. The Pal Maile is alſo honourable: as for the French Kyles, the Byas Bowles, the caſting of the ſton, the Barre, and ſuch like exerciſes, they are fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in my opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for a Citizens prentice, &amp; a countrey Clowne, then for anie Gentleman.</p>

               <p>For one time that <hi>Dauid</hi> triumphed in ſingle Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate againſt the great <hi>Giant,</hi> who fought in an vniuſt action, we read of a thouſand, who haue gotten the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie in defending a bad cauſe, both for the publike &amp; their owne particular. The hiſtorie of the Kings of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> &amp; <hi>Iſrael,</hi> yea the whole bible are ful of ſuch exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, to teach vs (I ſaie) that Gods Almightie hand is not alwaies tied and ſubiect by anie natural bond vnto the right of anie people, or of ſome few perſons in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular: but that he worketh al things both good and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil by his powerful prouidence vnto his owne glorie, yea that hee draweth the victories, which the wicked haue ouer the good men, &amp; the feeble ouer the ſtrong, and the Coward aboue the Courageous, to the honor of his Diuine Maieſtie, which is is only permanent &amp;
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:8512:130"/> vnchangeable. Among the Heathen you ſee that one <hi>Horatius</hi> who was a wicked man of himſelfe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended a verie bad cauſe, killed the honorable and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt <hi>Curatians,</hi> who were enemis vnto the <hi>Romane</hi> Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranie. Likewiſe the vſurper <hi>Alexander</hi> the great's Cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion overcame <hi>Darius</hi> his Captaine, who defended his Princes lawful right, who is renou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ed in al hiſtories, to haue beene a good religious Prince, agreeable and beloued of al men for his vpright Iudgment: ſo naked <hi>Dioſippus</hi> the <hi>Athenian</hi> hauing onlie a club in his hand ouercame the Armed <hi>Macedonian,</hi> hauing both a pike and a ſword to defend himſelfe in the preſence of <hi>Alexander;</hi> whoſe ſouldiers they were both.</p>
               <p>Therefore I councel you to conſider that there is no Valour, or great Courage to be euery day ſwagring, and running to the field, with litle or no regard of your life, which is the Kings, and which yee ſhould preſerue carefully, to hazard it onlie for his cauſe, as your prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors haue done heretofore. Nothing could moue them to draw their ſwords, which they held of the king for his defence onlie, but the common cauſe. They could not be more offended with the vndiſcreet words of anie man, then the Light of the Sun can bee obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the darknes of the Clowdes. As they required words with words onlie, ſo would I haue you to do, and to ſay with <hi>Tiberius,</hi> let vs forget reports &amp; falſe bruits, or giue them leaſure to grow old. For if wee be angrie, they maie be thought true, if we neglect them, they ſhal be eſteemed falſe. And truelie reportes are like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſmoke, which if it haue paſſage it euaniſheth awaie, without anie adoe, but if it be kept in, <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>it wil ſoone take

               <p>Jt is a too groſſe opinion to thinke that anie Noble mans honor dependeth vpon an other mans word: for properlie no man can be depriued of his honor, but by himſelfe, in flying from vertue to embrace vice. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe I wil not infer that yee ſhoulde ſuffer your ſelues to be abuſed in action, rather then that ſhould be, J woulde councel a Gentleman to <hi>anſwere a foole, according to his folly: (Homo ſum, nihil humani àme ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enum puto.</hi>) The Gods themſelues are iealous of their honour, as they confeſſe:

How dangerous it is, yee maie eaſilie perceiue; for if your Second be ouercome anie waies, then you muſt fight againſt two: for I know not wherfore an aſſiſtant ſhould ſhew anie fauour to his fellowes enimie, hauing ouercome his owne, more then a ſouldier, ſhould ſee his companion ſet vpon in a battaile, and not helpe him; though there bee but on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him.

               <p>Next, ſeeing your cheife ende in trauelling ſhoulde bee to become more prudent, my aduiſe is that you contemne not, nor miſpriſe anie good councel, howe baſe ſoeuer the perſon bee that giueth it; reſpect not the ſpeaker, but that which is ſpoken, and cheifly if you heare that his life is correſpondent to his words, be he neuer of ſo ſimple or bare a coat. for as <hi>Cato<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>Truſt not, nor miſtruſt ſtrangers, but keepe your ſelfe betweene the two, without anie demonſtration of ether of them. To bee to confident in anie man, it is dangerous: and to ſhew that you miſtruſt him, is offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue, and maketh him to bee your enimie: keep alwaies the bridle raines euen in your hande; nether to ſlacke, nor too ſtraight.</p>
